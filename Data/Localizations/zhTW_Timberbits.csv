Building.TimHortons.FlavorDescription,“如果你不咀嚼Timberbits，你還是海狸嗎？” ——恩戈內爾女士,"Ma' Ngonel is an almost legendary figure - a beaver grandma, known for her stern hand, cooking skills and respect among both kits and adult beavers. Her name is an inside joke, as our community constantly demands an addition of catapults, mangonels etc."
